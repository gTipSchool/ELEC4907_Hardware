# ELEC4907_Hardware
Hardware files (SV RTL and interfacing Python scripts) for the Neuromorphic Hardware 4th year project at Carleton University.

Includes RTL and a Xilinx Vivado project for implementation on the Virtex-7 FPGA, as well as testbenches (tb) for the various layers of abstraction.

Software includes python, which is used to interface with the FPGA implementation through UART. There is also HLS (high level synthesis) software in C/C++, which creates top-level wrappers given a network configuration text document.
